Title: rfgap produces random forest proximities of various types
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Jake S. Rhodes

Description: RF-GAP is a redefined random forest proximity measure which accurately captures 
    the data geometry learned from the random forest.  OOB accuarcy is perfectly preserved
    under this proximity definition. This package allows the user to create various types of
    random forest proximities and is the package used for the experiments in the paper
    "Geometry- and Accuracy-Preserving Random Forest Proximities."
